	"objective": "This course is designed to train operators to safely and effectively operate and maintain drinking water treatment plants.",
	"scope": "This course is designed to train operators in the practical aspects of operating and maintaining water treatment plants with an emphasis on safe practices. The material presented includes an introduction to water treatment plants, the role of the operator, source water, reservoir management, and intake structures. Learn how to safely operate and maintain coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration, and disinfection processes. Also discussed are methods to control tastes and odors in drinking water, control corrosion to meet Lead and Copper Rule requirements, perform basic water laboratory procedures, and complete math calculations commonly used in plant operation. This course covers: daily operating procedures, regulation of flows, chemical use and handling, records and reports, plant maintenance, safety, emergency conditions and procedures, handling complaints, and energy conservation. The goal is to provide operators with an understanding of basic water treatment plant operational concepts and practices, and with the ability to recognize, analyze, and solve problems when they occur.",
