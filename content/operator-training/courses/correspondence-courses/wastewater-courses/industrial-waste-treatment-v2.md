	"scope": "This course is designed to train operators in the practical aspects of operating and maintaining industrial wastewater treatment plants, emphasizing safe practices and procedures. Topics covered include the importance and responsibilities of an industrial treatment plant operator, fixed growth processes (trickling filters and rotating biological contactors), activated sludge process control, sequencing batch reactors, enhanced biological treatment (including nitrogen and phosphorus removal), anaerobic treatment, residual solids management, and plant and equipment maintenance. Operators will learn how to control these treatment processes under normal and abnormal conditions and how to analyze and solve operational problems.",
