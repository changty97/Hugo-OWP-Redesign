	"objective" : "This course is designed to train operators to safely and effectively operate, maintain, and troubleshoot the membrane bioreactor wastewater treatment process.",
	"scope": "The membrane bioreactor (MBR) wastewater treatment process uses a suspended growth bioreactor (typically found in activated sludge treatment processes) coupled with a membrane filtration process such as microfiltration or ultrafiltration. This manual describes the MBR process; explains how to operate, maintain, and troubleshoot the process; stresses safe procedures for cost-effective operation and maintenance (O&M); and helps operators develop strategies for correcting MBR failures. The manual covers how computer technology, including SCADA, can be used to perform MBR process control functions. Also included are procedures for implementing a comprehensive start-up, commissioning, and training phase prior to the complete transfer of an MBR plant to O&M staff.",
