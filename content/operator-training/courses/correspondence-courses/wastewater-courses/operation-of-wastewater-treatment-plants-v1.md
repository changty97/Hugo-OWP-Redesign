	"objective": "This course provides operators with the knowledge and skills needed to operate and maintain wastewater treatment plants effectively and, essentially, to do their jobs well.",
	"scope": "This course trains operators in the practical aspects of operating and maintaining wastewater treatment plants, emphasizing safe practices and procedures. This manual is designed to provide you with an understanding of basic operation and maintenance concepts and with an ability to analyze and solve problems when they occur on the job. Operation and maintenance programs for wastewater treatment plants vary based on the design and age of the system, the effectiveness of previous programs, and local environmental conditions such as climate. You can adapt the information and procedures discussed in this manual to your particular situation. The Chapter Review at the end of each chapter gives operators the ability to self-assess their understanding of the material by answering fill-in, matching, and multiple-choice questions.",
