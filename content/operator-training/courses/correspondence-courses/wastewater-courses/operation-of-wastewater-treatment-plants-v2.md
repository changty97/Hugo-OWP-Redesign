		"title": "Activated Sludge (Operation of Conventional Activated Sludge Plants)",
		"text": "<p>The activated sludge process is a very important wastewater treatment process. For this reason, the chapters on activated sludge have been divided into three parts and will be presented in three separate manuals.<br><br>I. Package Plants and Oxidation Ditches (Volume I)<br>II. Operation of Conventional Activated Sludge Plants (Volume II)<br>III. Pure Oxygen Plants and Operational Control Options (Advanced Waste Treatment)<br><br>If you are the operator of a package plant or oxidation ditch, Volume I will provide you with the information you need to know to operate your plant. Volume II and the Advanced Waste Treatment manual will help you better understand your plant and do a better job. If you operate a conventional activated sludge plant or a modification, Volume I will help you understand the activated sludge process and Volume II will tell you how to operate your plant. The Advanced Waste Treatment manual will explain to you alternative means of operational control that may work very well for your plant. If you operate a pure oxygen plant, the Advanced Waste Treatment manual will tell you what you need to know to operate the pure oxygen system. All three parts contain information important to the proper operation of your plant. The Advanced Waste Treatment manual also contains information helpful to operators using the activated sludge process to treat special wastes such as industrial wastes.<br><br>The following objectives apply to the treatment plants covered in each of the three parts. After completion of the appropriate part on activated sludge, students should be able to: <ol><li>Explain the principles of the activated sludge process and the factors that influence and control the process.</li><li>Inspect a new activated sludge facility for proper installation.</li><li>Place a new activated sludge process into service.</li><li>Schedule and conduct operation and maintenance duties.</li><li>Collect samples, interpret lab results, and make appropriate adjustments in treatment processes.</li><li>Recognize factors that indicate an activated sludge process is not performing properly, identify the source of the problem, and take corrective action.</li><li>Conduct their duties in a safe fashion</li><li>Determine aerator loadings and understand the application of different loading guidelines.</li><li>Keep records for an activated sludge plant.</li><li>Identify the common modifications of the activated sludge process.</li><li>Review plans and specifications for an activated sludge plant.</li><li>Describe each of the process stages used to treat wastewater in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR).</li><li>Place a new sequencing batch reactor in service.</li><li>Collect and analyze samples and make appropriate process adjustments during start-up and normal operation.</li><li>Safely operate and maintain a sequencing batch reactor.</li><li>Review plans and specifications for a sequencing batch reactor.</li></ol></p>"
