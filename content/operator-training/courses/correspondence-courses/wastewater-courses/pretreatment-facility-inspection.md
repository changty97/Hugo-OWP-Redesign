	"objective" : "This course is designed to train inspectors to safely and efficiently inspect industrial pretreatment facilities.",
	"scope": "The purpose of this course is to train operators to become pretreatment facility inspectors and to improve the knowledge and skills of current inspectors. The course stresses duties and responsibilities, including ethical responsibilities, of pretreatment inspectors. Topics covered include development and application of regulations, sources of industrial wastewater, source control processes and procedures, monitoring wastewater flows, and collecting and transporting representative samples. Operators will also learn how to respond to emergencies, limit the impact of an incident, and take enforcement action. Administrative topics include public relations; planning and funding an industrial waste pretreatment program; developing a database management program; and implementing an industrial waste monitoring program. Detailed procedures are provided to help operators prepare for inspections. Also included are lists of pertinent questions that should be answered when inspecting various types of industries.",
