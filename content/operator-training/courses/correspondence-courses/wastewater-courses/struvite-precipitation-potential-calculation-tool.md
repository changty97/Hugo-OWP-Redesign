	"scope": "Struvite scale forms in wastewater digestion and post-digestion processes, often fouling equipment and obstructing pipes. Some facilities expend significant maintenance resources removing struvite accumulation and some facilities attempt to control struvite formation. The struvite tool is designed to calculate the struvite precipitation potential for a facility based on water quality parameters input by the user. It also allows the user to vary input parameters to determine 'what if' scenarios when conditions are changed to control struvite precipitation. This tool is a must for struvite control planning.<br><br>The CD runs within Microsoft ExcelÂ® and comes with complete operating instructions.",
