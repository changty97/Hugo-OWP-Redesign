Our new online math courses present math that water and wastewater operators use on the job. The courses are delivered in a modular format, so students can customize the learning experience by selecting course topics that fit individual needs. Each course is offered in two formats: continuing education units (CEUs) course and non-CEU course. Our non-CEU courses let students focus on reviewing or learning job-related math concepts without having to take tests for course completion or to earn continuing education units (CEUs).

CEU course offerings ($156 each):

- 101C—Math Applications in Collection Systems
- 102C—Math Applications in Water Treatment
- 103C—Math Applications in Water Distribution

Non-CEU course offerings ($106 each):

- 101N—Math Applications in Collection Systems
- 102N—Math Applications in Water Treatment
- 103N—Math Applications in Water Distribution

These affordable courses help students develop a clear understanding of how to perform everyday water and wastewater operator math calculations and feature:

- Detailed explanations of common math concepts
- Step-by-step example problems with interactive features
- Check Your Understanding questions for learning self-check
- Access from anywhere that has an internet connection

(Note to Texas and Washington operators: Your states require that your exams be proctored and that an affidavit be signed by your proctor. After purchase, you will receive detailed proctoring instructions.)
