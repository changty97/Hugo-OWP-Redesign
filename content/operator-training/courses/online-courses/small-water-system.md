 - title: "Small Water System: Wells  (702A)"
   desc: "This course teaches operators how to set up a wellhead protection program, identify parts of a well and pump system, maintain and rehabilitate a well, and operate and maintain a well pump and hydro-pneumatic pressure tank. Operators will learn how to inspect, keep accurate records, and troubleshoot problems in wells and pumping systems. This course also presents information on disinfecting wells and pumps, and removing sand from water mains. In addition, this course describes types of wells and drilling methods, and will teach operators how to select a well site, test and evaluate a well and pump, and abandon and plug a well that is no longer productive or needed."
