This online course is based on a [California Stormwater Quality Association](https://www.casqa.org/resources/bmp-handbooks) (CASQA) Best Management Practice handbook and is designed to provide continuing education for professional engineers, municipal and regulatory agency employees, developers, construction companies, and others to increase their knowledge of stormwater best management practices.

Students complete our course using a CASQA <u>BMP</u> handbook and a study guide on CD. The final exam is completed online, allowing for instant grade results. Upon successful completion of the final exam, students earn 2 <u>CEUs</u> for the completed course.

CASQA’s ”New Development and Redevelopment“ BMP Handbook has been updated and is now available in online-only format. For more information, visit: [https://www.casqa.org/resources/bmp-handbooks](https://www.casqa.org/resources/bmp-handbooks).
