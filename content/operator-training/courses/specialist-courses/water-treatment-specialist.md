We offer two certificate programs for academic credit.Both the **Water Treatment Plant Operation Specialist Certificate Program** and the [Wastewater Treatment Plant Operation Specialist Certificate Program](/operator-training/courses/specialist-courses/wastewater-treatment-specialist/) are designed for operators and students interested in earning academic credit from a university that may be transferred to other colleges/universities. Registration requires university enrollment in Sacramento State's College of Continuing Education.

**If you are not planning to transfer your academic units to a college degree program, and are interested in earning continuing education units (CEUs), our other [course offerings](/operator-training/) can meet your needs.**

Students enrolled in this certificate program earn 6 units of academic credit or 90 contact hours for each course completed. Upon completion of all three courses in the certificate program, students earn a Water Treatment Plant Operation Specialist Certificate, awarded by California State University, Sacramento.

Each course costs **$912** and includes university enrollment, exam materials, administration and grading of an online final exam, and academic credits. Related training manuals and other materials are sold separately and prices are subject to change.
