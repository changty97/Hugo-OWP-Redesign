courseInfo: 
 - question: "How do I know which course I should take?"
   answer: ["The Office of Water Programs cannot recommend specific courses to students because each state has its own certification requirements. For certification information, contact your state's certification officer; you can find their contact information at: Association of Boards of Certification (ABC)"]

 - question: "How do I become a water or wastewater operator?"
   answer: ["If you're just beginning to think about operator training, here's some certification information to help you get started."]

 - question: "How do these self-study training courses work?"
   answer: ["Study the course material at your own pace. Manuals may include self-study course instructions near the table of contents to help you successfully complete the course. Chapters include section or review questions that can be used to test your knowledge of the material as you move through it. One method of study is to familiarize yourself with the material in a chapter and to then take the chapter objective test before starting the next chapter. When enrolled in a course, you can complete your objective tests online using a computer, tablet, or smartphone or via paper. Testing instructions are provided when you enroll in a course."]

 - question: "How much time is allowed to finish each course?"
   answer: ["Courses worth 0.6 to 3.0 continuing education units (CEUs) must be completed within three (3) months of the date of enrollment.", 
   "Courses worth 3.1 to 9.0 CEUs must be completed within six (6) months of the date of enrollment", 
   "Certificate program courses for academic credit must be completed within six (6) months of enrollment.", "CASQA Stormwater BMP courses (WAT 614 Series) worth 2.0 CEUs must be completed within six (6) months of enrollment."]

 - question: "Why do you stop grading older editions after a new edition is published?"
   answer: ["New editions of our courses are developed to ensure that students receive the most current information about processes, regulations, and technologies. Once an edition has been replaced with a more current version, it is no longer appropriate to grade tests that are based on outdated material. Courses that have been successfully completed may only be repeated when a revised edition becomes available.",
   "During the transition period from one edition to the next (usually 6 months) we grade both versions to accommodate those students who had just begun the course when the new edition became available.", 
   "To ensure the best test results, it is important that the edition of the manual you are using matches the edition of the course you are enrolled in."]

 - question: "How long will it take me to study for the course?"
   answer: ["The time to complete each course depends upon each person. Each individual sets his or her own pace, but must establish a regular schedule such as one or two evenings a week or on Saturday mornings. Most students require from 50 to 150 hours of study to complete each course."]

 - question: "How do the online courses work?"
   answer: ["Online courses are delivered over the Internet, and include lessons, readings, video clips, student exercises, and online exams. The readings, student exercises, and video clips are contained on a companion CD that integrates with the online materials. Please be sure you can meet the System Requirements before completing your purchase.", 
   "For a complete list of online offerings, see our Online Courses page. (Note to Texas and Washington operators: Your states require that your exams be proctored and that an affidavit be signed by your proctor. After purchase, you will receive detailed proctoring instructions.)"]

 - question: "Can I take more than one course at a time?"
   answer: ["You may take more than one course at a time, but remember that the course time limits apply to each course you order. That means that if you enroll in two courses with 6-month time limits at the same time, you must finish both within the same 6-month period. Enrollment time limits begin on the date you place your order."]

 - question: "I have more answer sheets than there are chapters—do I need to do the final exam?"
   answer: ["No. The extra sheets are in case you make a mistake. The Final Exam/Comprehensive Review Questions are provided for you to review how well you remember the material."]

 - question: "I have answer sheets but no questions—why didn't I receive a question booklet?"
   answer: ["For some courses, the test questions are inside the manual at the end of each chapter and no separate question booklet is needed. Courses without separate question booklets are:", 
   "Pretreatment Facility Inspection", "Small Water Systems Video Information Series"]

 - question: "Do exams need to be proctored?"
   answer: ["Some states have proctoring requirements for course exams. For more information, please see State Requirements."]

 - question: "Can I have orders sent to prisons?"

Some prisons don't allow delivery of books. Others place a limit on the number of items contained in a package.",

We also cannot allow gifts to be sent anonymously to inmates; the sender's billing address will appear on the payment receipt included in the package.", 
   "Because inmates cannot sign for deliveries, packages must be sent via US Mail. To avoid delivery problems, you might consider having the items shipped to you via UPS and then shipping them to the prison via US Mail."]
