All student data collected by the Office of Water Programs (OWP), which may include address, email, IP address, and the last four digits of their social security number, become student records of the California State University system, including California State University, Sacramento, and are kept at OWP in accordance with the Information Practices Act (IPA) and Title 5, as encrypted data. The Information Practices Act, California Civil Code Section 1798, et seq. requires the campus to collect, use, maintain and disseminate information relating to individuals in accordance with its provisions. Additionally, Sections 42396 through 42396.5 of Title 5 of the California Code of Regulations address privacy and the principles of personnel information management. Students are required to include the correct last four digits of their social security numbers (individual taxpayer identification numbers) in designated places on enrollments. OWP uses the last four digits of the social security number only to identify records pertaining to the student.

The last four digits of the students social security number are only used and required as the individual identifier in all student records, which may include:

1. registration records
2. enrollment/transcript records
3. records maintained by OWP

Failure to provide the last four digits of the social security number can result in the student not receiving credit for the course. Such personally identifiable records are not shared or distributed to private individuals or agencies unless such sharing or distribution is authorized by the student or unless otherwise lawfully available.
