		"title": "California Phase II Low Impact Development (LID) Sizing Tool",
		"desc": " The California Phase II Low Impact Development (LID) Sizing Tool is a web-based tool designed to assist stormwater practitioners in selecting and sizing LID Best Management Practices (BMPs) that meet sizing requirements in California's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit for stormwater discharges from small municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4s). Development of the LID Sizing Tool was funded by the California State Water Resources Control Boards (SWRCB) Proposition 84 Stormwater Grant Program (SWGP). The tool was developed by California State University, Sacramento's Office of Water Programs.",

		"title": "Basin Sizer",
		"desc": " Basin Sizer is a software program that assists users in sizing stormwater basins anywhere in California. The program calculates water quality volumes (WQVs) and water quality flows (WQFs) using a variety of methods and data from rainfall stations throughout the state. Project locations can be selected easily by zooming and panning across a map.",

		"desc": " The OWP Hydrologic Analysis Tool (HAT) standardizes calculations for event-based stormwater monitoring. It was created to prepare hydrographs for stormwater-related studies conducted by the Office of Water Programs (OWP) at California State University, Sacramento. Starting with version 2.0, HAT is being made freely available to the public for use with their required NPDES Permit monitoring and stormwater studies.",

		"title": "Struvite Tool",
		"desc": " Struvite scale forms in wastewater digestion and post-digestion processes, often fouling equipment and obstructing pipes. Some facilities expend significant maintenance resources removing struvite accumulation and some facilities attempt to control struvite formation. The struvite tool is designed to calculate the struvite precipitation potential for a facility based on water quality parameters input by the user. It also allows the user to vary input parameters to determine 'what if' scenarios when conditions are changed to control struvite precipitation. This tool is a must for struvite control planning. It runs within Microsoft Excel and comes with complete operating instructions",

		"title": " Water Quality Planning Tool",
		"desc": " The goal of the WQPT is to provide planners with an easy-to-use web site that has watershed information needed to create and comply with stormwater permits. Users can find a watershed through interactive maps or by entering the post-mile of a project location. For each watershed the following information is displayed:1. Water bodies with TMDLs 2. Water bodies on the 303(d) list 3. Water quality standards based on the State Ocean Plan and Basin Plans 4. Location of Caltrans facilities (highways/freeways, maintenance facilities, park & ride lots, and rest areas) 5. Maps and aerial photographs of the watershed",
