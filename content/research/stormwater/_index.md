OWP research staff participates in design, operation, maintenance, and performance testing of treatment BMPs, characterization of stormwater discharges, development and implementation of stormwater monitoring protocols and guidance, and overall stormwater management program assistance.

We have cited many projects that exemplify our experience for such services. Please note that it is not OWP's intent to take full credit for the cited projects; most projects consisted of collaboration between state agencies, other universities, and private consultants, as well as our research staff. OWP's involvement included primarily review and consultation services for project planning, design, construction, operation, maintenance, monitoring, data assessment, and reporting, while the brunt of such activities was provided by the great minds (and muscles) of our affiliates.
