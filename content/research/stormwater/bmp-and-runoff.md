OWP has supported Caltrans and its consultants in dozens of best management practice (BMP) verification studies, including vegetated strips and swales, sand and alternative media filters, bioretention systems, chemical treatment, litter and gross solids removal devices, infiltration systems, and porous pavement are some of the BMPs evaluated. To support and align these studies, OWP participated in development of Caltrans <a href=''>BMP Pilot Study Guidance Manual</a>, <a href=''>Stormwater Monitoring Guidance Manual</a>, <a href=''>Treatment BMP Technology Report</a>, and Hydrologic Utility Tool.",

		"title": "Kristar Filter Evaluations",
		"desc": "OWP conducted laboratory evaluations of the hydraulic and pollutant reduction performance of a The KriStar PerkFilterTM and the Kristar TreePod®. Clean water was used to estimate hydraulic capacity at different water depths up to bypass conditions. For the PerkFilterTM, pollutant removal was estimated by measuring the water quality before and after loading the filters with synthetic stormwater. Both ground silica and street dust were used as a sediment source. For the TreePod® pollutant removal was estimated by measuring the water quality of the influent and effluent of the filter. Representative influent concentrations were achieved by using street dust that was collected from street sweepers and sieved to exclude particles larger than 75 microns.",

For this project, several different engineered soil media and bioretention design configurations were tested on the campus of California State University, Sacramento. To ensure realistic simulation of full-scale bioretention, field mesocosms were built and vegetated, and tests were conducted with real stormwater runoff. OWP’s study tasks included laboratory-screening experiments, construction of field mesocosms, field experiments, and development of design guidance based on the results of the field experiments.

This laboratory evaluation compared the effectiveness of four drain inlet inserts. The effectiveness was estimated for two types of conditions: (1) spills or dumping during dry weather; and (2) low-level concentrations of oil, which are more typical for stormwater runoff.
