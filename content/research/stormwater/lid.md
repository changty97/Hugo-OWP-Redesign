		"title": "Implementation of City of Sacramento LID Standards at Sacramento State",
		"desc": "The City of Sacramento contracted with OWP in 2014 to manage and implement a grant from the CA State Water Resources Control Board. The project consisted of designing, installing, and monitoring stormwater low impact development (LID) best management practices (BMPs) on the campus of Sacramento State, as well as conducting an extensive education and outreach program that includes workshops, webinars, walking tours, and a regional LID conference. The City was the prime awardee because of a grant condition, but opted to contract with OWP to serve as the technical liaison between the City and university. OWP staff collaborated with multiple university entities to facilitate planning, design, and construction of multiple LID BMPs on campus, including bioretention planters, rain gardens, down spout disconnects, an infiltrating bioswale and porous pavement. OWP staff also performed BMP sizing using the Sacramento Hydrologic Model, conducted field monitoring, evaluated and documented performance results, and executed all outreach activities.
