		"title": "The ARB SWRP",
		"desc": "In 2016, the State Water Board’s Stormwater Grant Program provided OWP Proposition 1 grant funding to develop a Stormwater Resource Plan (SWRP) for the American River Basin (ARB), which spans Sacramento County and western Placer County in northern California. The SWRP contains watershed-based methodologies for developing, cataloging, ranking, and implementing projects that manage stormwater and dry weather runoff to improve water quality, reduce localized flooding, increase water supplies, protect environmental ecosystems, and enhance communities. OWP coordinated and executed planning and outreach efforts with various cooperating entities and regional stakeholders, including the Regional Water Authority, which oversees development and management of the ARB Integrated Regional Watershed Management Plan (IRWMP). Integration of the SWRP with the local IRWMP was required by the California Water Code. Additional cooperating entities included multiple stakeholders from the regional watershed stewardship groups; municipal stormwater permittees; water purveyors; and flood control, groundwater, and wastewater agencies.<br><br> Link: http://irwm.rmcwater.com/rwa/login.php (Enter as guest, then select “SWRP” from upper right corner)",
