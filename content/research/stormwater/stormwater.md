The portal includes background information related the limitations and possibilities for funding stormwater programs and projects. OWP provided narratives and tabulations related to grant and loan options available throughout the state as well as nationally, cost resources for estimating funding needed for both capital projects and their maintenance, and descriptions of multi-benefit projects that often provide a leg-up in receiving grant and loan awards.",

		"desc": "This cost survey was funded by the California State Water Resources Control Board to survey NPDES compliance costs of six municipalities with exemplary programs. The cost survey categorized costs as new costs (due solely to the NPDES permit requirements), enhanced costs (caused by permit requirements that enhanced existing programs), and costs that existed prior to the permit. The survey also categorized costs into the major stormwater program elements. Costs were normalized by number of households. Link: NPDES Cost Survey",

		"title": "Region 9 EFC Stormwater Financing Support",
		"desc": "OWP serves as the Environmental Finance Center (EFC) for EPA Region 9. The goal of the EFC is to enable state and local governments, tribal communities, and the private sector to become capable of funding environmental and public health services, in the short term, and to be able to adapt to future needs as regulations, technology, and resources evolve. In this capacity, EFC staff supported EPA in hosting two stormwater finance forums in 2016. EFC staff also guided two California municipalities in evaluating development of stormwater utility fees and other funding options to provide long-term financial support for their permit compliance and drainage programs. Support included development of tools for asset management, cost summaries, rate development, and residential ability-to-pay assessments, as well as creation of a how-to stormwater financing story board.",
