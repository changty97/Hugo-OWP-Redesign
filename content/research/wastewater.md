		"desc": "The California State Water Resources Control Board (State Water Board) awarded OWP $7 million in Proposition 1 funds to assist disadvantaged communities in addressing drinking water and wastewater issues. OWP’s services have included overseeing work plans that specify planning and design tasks, deliverables, budget and schedules for infrastructure projects such as pipelines, wells, tanks and water treatment, as well as planning efforts such as water entity consolidations. The work plans. The work plans are used to develop applications for construction funding, which is provided through a separate funding mechanism.",

		"title": "RegionalSan Ammonia Fate and Removal in Waste Water Treatment", 
		"desc": "The Sacramento Regional County Sanitation District (RegionalSan) contracted with OWP to conduct several literature reviews regarding the fate and removal of ammonia for various elements of the wastewater treatment process. Effluent discharges from wastewater treatment plants can contain high concentrations of ammonia, which can be toxic to specific species of plants and animals. Detailed studies included evaluating 1) the fate of ammonia in lagoon sludge treatment, 2) ammonia removal options for high purity oxygen activated sludge systems, 3) ammonia removal within wastewater side streams, 4) ammonia removal in wetlands, and 5) the relationship between the retention time and ammonia concentration in anaerobic sludge digestion.",

		"desc": "The Sacramento County Regional Sanitation District (RegionalSan) was evaluating whether to allow the use of PVC sewer pipe, in addition to continuing the use of VCP. As part of the assessment, RegionalSan wanted to compare the energy demands for manufacturing each type of pipe and the environmental impacts and sustainability of the two types of pipe materials. RegionalSan requested three literature reviews and reports comparing the energy demands, environmental impacts, and sustainability of PVC pipe and VCP for sanitary sewer use.",

		"title": "SASD Chemical Root Control for Sanitary Sewers", 
		"desc": "This study was conducted for the Sacramento Area Sewer District (SASD). Tree roots can infiltrate sanitary sewer piping systems through cracks and compromised pipe joints, causing flow blockages and contributing to sanitary sewer overflows. Root intrusion can be mitigated using mechanical or chemical root removal techniques. This involved conducting a literature review and developing a report on the environmental and human health impacts of chemicals used for root control.",

		"desc": "This study, conducted for the Sacramento Area Sewer District (SASD), involved conducting a literature review on documented environmental and human health impacts resulting from unplanned, untreated wastewater discharges. Unplanned discharges of untreated wastewater from collection systems can occur due to pipe blockages or failures or to hydraulic overload resulting from severe storm events.",

		"title": " Evaluation of Methods to Control Fouling in Microfiltration Membranes", 
		"desc": " Membrane filtration is a promising technology for treating wastewater. However, as particulate matter accumulates on the membrane, the energy requirements for maintaining a specified flux increase, often making this technology economically infeasible. This study involved assessing membrane configurations for tertiary treatment, with an emphasis on identifying ways to control membrane fouling. OWP conducted a literature review and assisted with field testing strategies and data assessment. ",

		"title": "USEPA & State Water Board Metal Plating Industry Pollution Prevention Training Manual", 
		"desc": "The metal plating industry can generate significant waste streams containing heavy metals that are discharged to municipal sewers. Municipal pretreatment inspectors are charged with the responsibility to monitor metals discharges from plating shops and to enforce permit provisions. This project involved developing and providing training to address pollution prevention techniques in the metal plating industry for pretreatment inspectors. By educating inspectors, who would pass the information on to metal plating shop owners, the funding regulators hoped to reduce metals discharges. The project was conducted for the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the California State Water Resources Control Board.",

		"title": " Heavy Metals Removal Using Coagulation and Flocculation", 
		"desc": " Wastewater treatment plants are subject to effluent discharge limitations on heavy metals. Conventional wastewater treatment processes are not effective in removing heavy metals from wastewater, which can result in discharge violations if metals enter the waste stream. This study included conducting coagulation and flocculation tests to assess the effectiveness of metals removal. Specific OWP activities included assisting with study planning, data assessment, and report development.",

		"title": "Struvite Assessment and Tool Development", 
		"desc": "Struvite scale forms in wastewater digestion and post-digestion processes, often fouling equipment and obstructing pipes. Some facilities expend significant maintenance resources removing struvite accumulation, and some facilities attempt to control struvite formation. Design decisions and operation and maintenance strategies for wastewater treatment facilities are affected by struvite scale potential. OWP developed a computer model, the “Struvite Tool,” to calculate the struvite precipitation potential for a facility based on water quality parameters input by the user. The tool also allows the user to vary input parameters to determine “what if” scenarios when conditions are changed to control struvite precipitation. OWP used this tool to develop a mitigation plan to prevent struvite formation for the City of Boulder, Colorado wastewater treatment plan. ",
