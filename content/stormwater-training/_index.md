## Stormwater BMP

OWP offers a distance learning course based on a CASQA Best Management Practice (BMP) handbook. This [online BMP course](/stormwater-training/bmp/) is designed to provide continuing education to professional engineers, municipal and regulatory agency employees, developers, construction companies, and others seeking to increase their knowledge of stormwater BMPs. The training course is approved by the California Water Environment Association (CWEA) and by certification boards in more than 20 states.

CASQA’s “New Development and Redevelopment BMP Handbook” has been updated and is now available in online-only format. For more information, visit: [https://www.casqa.org/resources/bmp-handbooks](https://www.casqa.org/resources/bmp-handbooks).
