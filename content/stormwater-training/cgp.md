Interested in becoming a QSD and QSP? Here is what you should know before you begin:

- You must attend an in-person training before you register for an exam.
- The registration fee for exams is $125. This covers both the QSP and the QSD exam.
- If you fail the QSP exam, no certificates will be awarded.
- If you pass the QSP exam but fail the QSD exam, you will be awarded a QSP certificate.
- If you fail one exam, you are allowed one retake for a $67 fee. If you need to retake both exams, you only pay one $67 fee.
