2. **Complete the online training**  
Training consists of videos, quizzes, and reading assignments. You may take the self-assessment quizzes as often as you like. Quiz grades do not affect your completion of the training. However, you do need to understand the material presented in the online training to pass the exams. The training can take 16 hours or more to complete, depending on your level of expertise in the field.

3. **Pass a midterm exam**  
You have two attempts to pass the 35-question midterm with a grade of 70% or higher. The exam must be completed in a single two-hour session.

4. **Complete the one-day, in-person training with an IGP ToR**  
After passing the midterm exam, QISP candidates can access the IGP ToR training class calendar to register for the in-person training.

5. **Pass the final exam**  
You have two attempts to pass the 70-question final exam with a grade of 70% or higher. The exam must be completed in a single four-hour session.

You have two years to complete the entire process. If you do not complete the training within two years, or if you fail an exam twice, you will need to re-register at a cost of $70 and redo all of the training steps.
