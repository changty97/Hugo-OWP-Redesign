The Office of Water Programs (OWP) is pleased to offer a Graduate Research Fellowship for students currently pursuing master's degrees at California State University, Sacramento. This Fellowship provides an opportunity for one or two students to fulfill their master's project/thesis requirement by completing a research-based project in collaboration with OWP. Fellows will have the opportunity to work alongside faculty and research staff, and will be reimbursed for part-time tuition (up to 6 units) plus a one-time continuation fee (if needed) upon successful completion of the project.

<div class="register-form-header">
	Eligibility
</div>

This fellowship program is open to all master's students currently enrolled at California State University, Sacramento, regardless of major or department. Applicants must have advanced to candidacy and be ready to complete their master's project. Part-time student interns at OWP may apply; full-time OWP employees are not eligible.

	Project
</div>

Selected applicants will complete a research-based project in collaboration with OWP research staff. The project scope should be such that it can be completed (up to the rough draft of the report) in approximately 150 hours over the course of 1 semester for a 3-unit class (300 hours for a 6-unit class).

Students may propose to work on an **OWP project** [(see attached list of project statements)](http://www.owp.csus.edu/research/graduate-fellowship-program/grf-problem-statements-spring-2019.pdf) or may propose a **project of their own.** All projects must be consistent with OWPs mission of providing cost-effective solutions for protecting and enhancing water resources, public health, and the environment through training, scientific research, and public education. All projects, whether they are developed by OWP or proposed by the applicant, must be approved by the applicant's academic advisor in order to receive academic credit.
