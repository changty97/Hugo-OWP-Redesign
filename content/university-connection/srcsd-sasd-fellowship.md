		Program Summary
	</div>

The Sacramento Regional County Sanitation District (Regional San) and Sacramento Area Sewer District (SASD), in conjunction with the Office of Water Programs (OWP), are pleased to offer a Sacramento Regional County Sanitation District and Sacramento Area Sewer District Graduate Research Fellowship (hereafter referred to as the Regional San-SASD Fellowship) for students currently pursuing master's degrees at California State University, Sacramento.

**Regional San's mission** is to protect public health and the environment by conveying, treating, and recovering resources from wastewater responsibly and cost effectively.

**SASD's mission** is to protect public health and the environment by efficiently and effectively collecting sewage for our community.

**OWP's mission** is providing cost-effective solutions for protecting and enhancing water resources, public health, and the environment through training, scientific research, and public education.

This Regional San-SASD Fellowship provides an opportunity for one student to fulfill his/her master's project/thesis requirement by completing a research-based project in collaboration with Regional San, SASD, and OWP. The Fellow will have the opportunity to work alongside faculty and research staff, and will be reimbursed for part-time tuition (up to 6 units) plus a one-time continuation fee (if needed) upon successful completion of the project.
