Water is a precious resource and water management is a complicated, contentious, and ultimately collaborative task. As stewards of the public trust and public health; and regulators of water quality, water rights, and drinking water; the State Water Board will consider actions on multiple issues of significance in California over the next few years. The successful outcomes of these efforts greatly depend on public, academia, and stakeholder engagement in working together to resolve long-standing water challenges.
