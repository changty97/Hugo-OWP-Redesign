      <description>Water is a precious resource and water management is a complicated, contentious, and ultimately collaborative task. As stewards of the public trust and public health; and regulators of water quality, water rights, and drinking water; the State Water Board will consider actions on multiple issues of significance in California over the next few years. The successful outcomes of these efforts greatly depend on public, academia, and stakeholder engagement in working together to resolve long-standing water challenges.</description>

      <description>Education and Outreach Campus LID Mobile Tour  &amp;nbsp;  This part of the project aimed to provide an opportunity for the public and stormwater professionals to see examples of how existing parking lots and streets can be retrofitted to include LID BMPs. Although retrofitting an existing urban space with new drainage systems presents many challenges, it also offers opportunities for improving the landscape. This tour lets you see these elements in a real-world setting.</description>

      <description>Awards 2015 Urban Development Project of the Year—American Society of Civil Engineers, Sacramento Section  &amp;nbsp;  This award is quite an honor for OWP and its project partners. It recognizes the success of installing 25 LID best management practices (BMPs) devices in existing infrastructure on the Sacramento State campus and the further-reaching goal of demonstrating effective methods for regional stormwater management and sustainability. 
&amp;nbsp; 2016 CASQA BMP Implementation Project of the Year   The project was recognized because it is exemplary and unique in the quantity and types of LID BMPs implemented, the retrofit nature of the project, the cooperative effort among several stormwater organizations, and the significant environmental and social improvements it provides.</description>

      <description>Monitoring the LID Sites  Lot 7 Monitoring and Sampling  OWP conducted flow monitoring and sampling during 7 separate storm events, starting November 15, 2015 and continuing until March 12, 2016. At Lot 7, 3 out of the 6 total LID devices were monitored and sampled. Sampling and monitoring focused on total and dissolved metals, turbidity, total suspended solids, pesticides, temperature, and pH.
Lot 10 Monitoring and Sampling  Flow monitoring and sampling were also conducted at Lot 10 during 7 separate storm events from November 15, 2015 through March 12, 2016.</description>

      <description>2015 Sacramento Regional LID Conference
Alumni Center
Wed, Nov 4, 2015 OWP and the American Basin Council of Watersheds (ABCW) hosted the fifth Sacramento Regional LID Conference on Nov 4, 2015 at the Sacramento State Alumni Center. The intent for this biannual conference is for local government, planners, designers, developers and environmental organizations to learn about strategies for integrating LID into sustainable community planning, design and construction. The 2015 event was successful with close to 200 attendees and topics included Regulatory Drivers for LID, Municipal Permit Compliance, and LID Implementation.</description>

      <description>Background Project Overview  In 2015, Sacramento State’s Office of Water Programs (OWP) and Facilities Management teamed with the City of Sacramento to install new stormwater management devices on campus. The devices, or low impact development best management practices (LID BMPs), reduce stormwater impacts to the American and Sacramento Rivers. Stormwater runoff from urban development is one of the leading contributors to water quality degradation.
LID is the sustainability term for managing stormwater; it involves treating runoff close to its source, incorporating existing infrastructure to optimize feasibility, and enhancing pollutant load reduction through stormwater infiltration, retention, and treatment.</description>

Our new online math courses present math that water and wastewater operators use on the job. The courses are delivered in a modular format, so students can customize the learning experience by selecting course topics that fit individual needs. Each course is offered in two formats: continuing education units (CEUs) course and non-CEU course. Our non-CEU courses let students focus on reviewing or learning job-related math concepts without having to take tests for course completion or to earn continuing education units (CEUs).</description>
