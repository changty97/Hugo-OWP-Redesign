Our new online math courses present math that water and wastewater operators use on the job. The courses are delivered in a modular format, so students can customize the learning experience by selecting course topics that fit individual needs. Each course is offered in two formats: continuing education units (CEUs) course and non-CEU course. Our non-CEU courses let students focus on reviewing or learning job-related math concepts without having to take tests for course completion or to earn continuing education units (CEUs).</description>
